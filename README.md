# IoT-Based-Air-Control-Monitor-System-Visibility
This project develops a low-cost IoT-based air quality monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller. It collects real-time data on temperature, humidity, and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10) and transmits it to a web dashboard, enabling users to remotely monitor and respond to air pollution.
